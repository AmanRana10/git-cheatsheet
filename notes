==> After uploading a project on github , we don't need to repeat the entire process of entering our username,email and git init as it is already tracking our project so we just 
need add,commit and push them to our repository.

==> After pushing our changes to our local repository,we have to create a pull requeust to send it to the remote repo.

==> git remote add origin URL is used to connect our local project to our remote reopsitory.Basically it tells our computer which repository to push our changes in.
(It is used for new projects which do not have a remote repo on github)
**it creates a var type origin which we refer to as origin afterwards.
